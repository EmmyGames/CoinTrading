Brainstorm Crypto Trading Algorithm:

Goal:
Passively accumulate the amount of coins without putting down more money.

Given:
1. Must always have some amount of coins and some amount of USD in wallet
2. Off of given 1, trading must be done by proportions (percentages), as opposed to static amounts
3. Program will be controlled by API calls so there is a limit to the amount of calls per day (before paying).
4. Fees must be taken into consideration when determining whether to buy, sell, or hold.

Assumptions:
Buy low, sell high 100% of the time will increase the amount of coins.


Questions:
Lowering the average price per coin bought will increase the amount of coins?
Does this mean that increasing the average price per coin will hurt?



Hypothetically, the lower the price goes, the more amount should be bought
But if we are to never run out of USD and coins, this poses a potential problem
The larger amount bought and sold at once, the higher the risk/reward.
The larger the amount allows the ability to accumulate coins faster but has a higher risk of buying/selling too early
and/or running out of USD or coins.
